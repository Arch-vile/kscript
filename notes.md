```
apply plugin: 'java'

dependencies {
  runtime group: 'com.netflix.exhibitor', name: 'exhibitor-standalone', version: '1.5.2'
  runtime group: 'org.apache.zookeeper',  name: 'zookeeper', version: '3.4.6'
}

repositories { mavenCentral() }

task getDeps(type: Copy) {
  from sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
  into 'runtime/'
}
```
Download the dependencies (and their dependencies) into the folder runtime when you execute `gradle getDeps`.

Kotlin natively supports scripting to a limited extent, so it is valid to use #! (shebang) directives at the top of kotlin source files.

for dependency resolution also consider
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9407554/sbt-alternative-to-mvn-install-dskiptests

## kotlinc shebang config

http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/20880/how-can-i-use-environment-variables-in-my-shebang

Shebang lines do not undergo variable expansion, so you cannot use $FOO/MyCustomPython as it would search for an executable named dollar-F-O-O-...
